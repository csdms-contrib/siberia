SIBERIA MODEL
    This is a siberia models input file. The first line of the file 
    above is fixed and should not be edited. The next three lines (i.e these lines
    are for file description data and can be modified by the user
#
# ======================================================================================
#       This file contains the extnded models information for SIBERIA 
#      (including regional variations in runoff, erosion and tectonics, layering)
# ======================================================================================
#
#  The format of this file is as a series of example commands giving the
#  general format of the commands. The commands can be in any order and there
#  are no limits on the number of commands in the file. Each command is a 
#  single line of information.
#
#  We suggest that you copy the appropriate command line examples and edit copies
#  so that you always have copies of the original correct form of the command.
#
#  NB 1. All commands are independent of each other so that runoff and erosion
#     commands can be entered independently. However, the runoff commands are dependent
#     on each other with subsequent runoff commands working on the result of previous
#     runoff commands if the regions over which they apply are overlapping. The same 
#     is true of the erosion commands, tectonics, layers, etc. 
#
#     In particular, if you have regions
#     of different material you may change the runoff for that region and not the erosion
#     model if that is appropriate (and vice versa) or you may change both if
#     appropriate, or you may change one 'absolute' and one 'relative' if desired.
#
#     2. These commands assume that the erosion model and the runoff model are initially
#     everywhere uniform and determined by the b1, m1, n1, b3, n3 parameters specified in 
#     the RST2 file.
#
#                            Compatible with SIBERIA V8.31

# ======================================================================================
#                                  EROSION commands
# ======================================================================================
#
#   These commands are read in SIBERIA when the parameter ModeErode=3 and 
#   the EROSION file parameter=-1 is set to this file.
#
#                       The EROSION commands come in two forms:
#                       --------------------------------------
#                                GENERAL EROSION MODEL
#                                ---------------------
#   The most general form of the erosion commands from left to right is
#     - 'EROSION' indicating  this is an erosion command (starts in column 1)
#     - one of either 'ABSOLUTE' or 'RELATIVE' indicating
#          ABSOLUTE: the erosion parameters are as given
#          RELATIVE: the erosion parameters given are multipied with
#                   the erosion parameters at that point previously
#                   given .... ie. this changes the parameters by a relative amount
#     - the parameters b1, m1, n1. For RELATIVE these are interpretted as multipliers
#     - the region file for applying those parameters (it must inside '')
#
#   The command below replaces the erosion model over the region defined by test1.rgn
#   with an erosion model with b1(new)=0.01, m1(new)=0.6, n1(new)=0.7
#
#EROSION ABSOLUTE 0.01 0.6 0.7 'control\test1.rgn'
#
#   The command below replaces the erosion model over the region defined by test2.rgn
#   with an erosion model with b1(new)=0.05, m1(new)=0.2, n1(new)=0.3
#   NB. Because this command after the test1.rgn command where 
#       test1.rgn and test2.rgn overlap test2.rgn overwrites test1.rgn
#
#EROSION ABSOLUTE 0.05 0.2 0.3 'control\test2.rgn'
#
#   The command below modifies the erosion model over the region defined by test3.rgn
#   with an erosion model with b1(new)=b1(old)*0.1
#                              m1(new)=m1(old)*0.7 
#                              n1(new)=n1(old)*1.2
#   NB. Because this command after the test1.rgn and test2.rgn commands where 
#       test1.rgn, test2.rgn and test3.rgn overlap test3.rgn overwrites the other files
#
#EROSION RELATIVE 0.1 0.7 1.2 'control\test.rgn'
#
#
#                         ERODIBILITY ONLY EROSION MODEL
#                         ------------------------------
#
#   A more specific form of the erosion command only modifies the erodibility
#   and is of the form
#     - 'ERODIBILITY' indicating  this is an erosion command (starts in column 1)
#     - one of either 'ABSOLUTE' or 'RELATIVE' indicating
#          ABSOLUTE: the erosion parameters are as given
#          RELATIVE: the erosion parameters given are multipied with
#                   the erosion parameters at that point previously
#                   given .... ie. this changes the parameters by a relative amount
#     - the parameter b1. For RELATIVE these are interpretted as multipliers
#     - the region file for applying those parameters (it must inside '')
#
#   The command below modifies the erosion model over the region defined by test3.rgn
#   with an erosion model with b1(new)=b1(old)*0.1
#
#ERODIBILITY RELATIVE 0.1 'control\test.rgn'
#
#
#
# ======================================================================================
#                                      RUNOFF commands
# ======================================================================================
#
#   These commands are read in SIBERIA when the parameter ModeRunoff=3 and 
#   the RUNOFF file parameter=-2 is set to this file.
#
#   The general form of the erosion commands from left to right is
#     - 'RUNOFF' indicating  this is an runoff command (starts in column 1)
#     - one of either 'ABSOLUTE' or 'RELATIVE' indicating
#          ABSOLUTE: the runoff parameters are as given
#          RELATIVE: the runoff parameters given are multipied with
#                   the runoff parameters at that point previously
#                   given .... ie. this changes the parameters by a relative amount
#     - the parameters b3, m3. For RELATIVE these are interpretted as multipliers
#     - the region file for applying those parameters (it must inside '')
#
#
#   The command below replaces the runoff model over the region defined by test0.rgn
#   with a runoff model with b3(new)=1.0, m3(new)=0.8
#
#RUNOFF ABSOLUTE 1.0 1.0 'test1.rgn'
#
#
#   The command below updates the runoff model over the region defined by test1_2.rgn

#
#RUNOFF RELATIVE 2.0 0.9 'control\test1_2.rgn'
#
#

# ======================================================================================
#
#
#   These commands are read in SIBERIA when the parameter ModeChannel=3 and 
#   the CHANNEL file parameter=-6 is set to this file.
#
#   The general form of the erosion commands from left to right is
#     - 'CHANNEL' indicating  this is an runoff command (starts in column 1)
#     - one of either 'ABSOLUTE' or 'RELATIVE' indicating
#          ABSOLUTE: the runoff parameters are as given
#          RELATIVE: the runoff parameters given are multipied with
#                   the runoff parameters at that point previously
#                   given .... ie. this changes the parameters by a relative amount
#     - the parameters b5, m5, n5. For RELATIVE these are interpretted as multipliers
#     - the region file for applying those parameters  (it must inside '')
#
#CHANNEL RELATIVE 0.5 1.0 1.0 'control\test.rgn'

# ======================================================================================
#
#
#   These commands are read in SIBERIA when the parameter ModeChannel=4 and 
#   the UPLIFT file parameter=-3 is set to this file.
#
#   The general form of the erosion commands from left to right is
#     - 'UPLIFT' indicating  this is an runoff command (starts in column 1)
#     - one of either 'ABSOLUTE' or 'RELATIVE' indicating
#          ABSOLUTE: the uplift parameters are as given
#          RELATIVE: this mode is ignored in the current version (NB. RELATIVE or

# ======================================================================================
#
#

#
#   The general form of the erosion commands from left to right is
#     - 'UPLIFT' indicating  this is an runoff command (starts in column 1)
#     - one parameter: the known aggradation/timestep. Note is a positive number is input
#       this is interpretted as aggradation, whereas if a negative number if input this
#       is intrepretted as a degradation

#
#
#
# ======================================================================================
#                                  LAYERS MODULE commands
# ======================================================================================
#
#  Whenever a LAYERS file and ModeErode=4 is specified the file is read for all 
#  commands that start with LAYERS.
#
#  ALL lines starting with other commands (e.g. RUNOFF, UPLIFT) are ignored. Note
#  that RUNOFF and EROSION and ERODIBILITY commands conflict with LAYERS and errors
#  may occur if ModeErode=3 or ModeRunoff=3 is set in addition to a LAYER file.
#  
#  LAYER commands can be divided into four kinds.
#
#    - LAYER CONTROL. These commands allow the user to control the internal 
#         computational behaviour of the LAYER model (e.g. maximum thickness of layers).
#         Because they control how the layers module operates they should in general be
#         the first commands executed.
#    - LAYER PARAMETERS. These commands provide information about the erosion/runoff
#         model parameters that are to be used for subsequent LAYER commands (or until
#         they are superseded by a new LAYER parameter command).
#    - LAYER ELEVATION. These commands input the elevation properties of
#         the layer being created. The properties of the LAYER being created are those
#         input by the most recent LAYER PARAMETER commands.
#    - LAYER MASKING. These commands input information on the spatial extent of 
#         the LAYER currently being created. These commands allow you to create a LAYER
#         that is restricted in spatial extent so that it doesn't have to cover the
#         entire computational domain.
#    - LAYER DETACHMENT. These commands input information of the detachment limitation
#         of the material in that layer.
#
#
#   LAYER CONTROL COMMANDS
#   ----------------------
#
#   - How many tracers to track (default is 0). This command, if tracer tracking is to be done,
#     MUST be the first LAYER command executed. Current limit is a maximum of 5.
#
#LAYER NUMBER_TRACERS 2
#
#
#
#   - the maximum thickness of a layer created by SIBERIA during deposition. This does 
#     not preclude the user from inputting a thicker layer but all layers generated by 
#     the computations will have a maximum thickness as below. NB thin layers can
#     significantly increase the memory consumption of the code and this increase
#     may be superlinear (i.e. halving the layer thickness may increase memory 
#     consumption by more than a factor of 2).
#
#LAYER THICKNESS 0.1
#
#
#   LAYER PARAMETER COMMANDS
#   ----------------------
#
#   - the general format of these commands is as for the EROSION/RUNOFF models 
#     for region input at the top of this file, except that a region file is not
#     input as part of the command line. For instance for EROSION parameters input
#     is:
#     - 'EROSION' indicating  this is an erosion command (starts in column 1)
#     - one of either 'ABSOLUTE' or 'RELATIVE' indicating
#          ABSOLUTE: the erosion parameters are as given
#          RELATIVE: the erosion parameters given are multipied with
#                   the erosion parameters at that point previously
#                   given .... ie. this changes the parameters by a relative amount
#                   (initially the parameters are those set in the parameters input
#                    at the start)
#          DEFAULT:  sets the parameters back to the default values (those
#                    input in the parameters input at the start). This can be handy
#                    for resetting parameters when you have input lots of layers with
#                    RELATIVE parameters.
#     - the parameters. For RELATIVE these are interpretted as multipliers
#       on the last value for the parameters.
#     - there are parameters for the layer detachment limitation model are grouped 
#       at the end of the layer section
#
#
#   - Erosion model parameters 'b1,m1,n1'

#
#LAYER CREEP RELATIVE 0.6
#LAYER CREEP ABSOLUTE 0.01
#LAYER CREEP DEFAULT
#
#   - Layer tracer concentration (all inputs are absolute) for up to 5 tracers.

#LAYER TRACER_1 0.6
#LAYER TRACER_2 0.6
#LAYER TRACER_3 0.6
#LAYER TRACER_4 0.6
#LAYER TRACER_5 0.6
#
#
#   LAYER ELEVATION COMMANDS
#   ----------------------
#
#   - the commands for input of the elevations for the layers. NB the input elevations
#     are for the base of the layer unless otherwise noted (i.e. the layer extends 
#     upwards from the elevations input.
#
#   - a layer covering the surface of thickness given. The top of the capping layer
#     is the landform surface and the bottom of the capping is 'thickness' below that
#     surface
#LAYER CAPPING 2.1
#
#   - a layer with base horizontal and with the layer's base at the elevation given
#LAYER Z 25.2
#
#   - a layer that is a bilinear spline. the 1st 4 values are the coordinates of the 
#     four corners of the rectangular
#     region (in node coordinates), and the 2nd four values are the elevations at the 
#     four corners in the order SW, SE, NW, NE corners. 
#     NB. the spline extends over the 
#     whole domain and the corner coordinates are ONLY used to determine the elevations 
#     of the interpolated/extrapolated surface not the spatial extent of the surface
#     NB: BILINEAR_CLAMPED restricts the layer to the box specified.
#
#LAYER BILINEAR 1 20 1 30 10.0 20.0 22.0 35.0
#LAYER BILINEAR_CLAMPED 1 20 1 30 10.0 20.0 22.0 35.0
#
#   - a layer that has as its base the elevations as read from the rst2 file, 
#     with the elevations offset by
#     the specified value (i.e. a negative offset is a lower elevation). NB the areal 
#     extent of the RST2 file must match the RST2 file of the landform DEM.
#
#LAYER DEM -2.1 'TEST.RST2'
#
#
#   LAYER MASKING COMMANDS
#   ----------------------
#
#   - these commands specify over what part of the domain the layer will be created. If a 
#     mask is input and active then the layer will be created for the region specified
#     by the mask and will not be created outside the mask. For all other cases the 
#     layer will cover the entire region.
#
#   - the mask is that part of the domain specified by the region file. The mask
#     is automatically activated after input of the region file.
#
#LAYER REGION_MASK 'TEST.RGN'
#
#   - the mask is that a rectangle defined by the coordinates. The cordinates 
#     are in the order LOWX,HIGHX,LOWY,HIGHY where the rectangle coordinates 
#     are (LOWX,LOWY) and (HIGHX,HIGHY). The mask
#     is automatically activated after input of the region file.
#
#LAYER REGION_CLIP 0 10 5 35
#
#   - Any mask that has been input can be inactivated (i.e. turned off). In the event 
#     that the is needed again then it can activated by setting REGION_ACTIVE ON. NB. 
#     This command does not delete the mask ... it only turns it off ... it can always be 
#     turned back on again later (unless the mask is overwritten with another RGN file in 
#     the meantime by a #LAYER REGION_FILE command).
#
#LAYER REGION_ACTIVE OFF
#
#   - If a mask has been input from a region file then this activates it (i.e. turns it 
#     on). If no region file has been input then the command is ignored.
#
#LAYER REGION_ACTIVE ON
#
#
#   LAYER DETACHMENT MODEL COMMANDS
#   -------------------------------
#
#   - Relative Detachment Rate
#
#   - To turn detachment limitation ON (once ON it cannot be turned off)
#
#LAYER DETACHMENT ON
#
#   - Set the Relative detachment rate for that layer's material  (Default is 1.0)
#
#LAYER DETACHMENT RELATIVE 0.6
#LAYER DETACHMENT ABSOLUTE 0.01
#LAYER DETACHMENT DEFAULT
